            <p style="text-align: justify;">On this page, I investigated app/product performance from various aspects
              such as the daily active user(DAU), retention curve, traffic source, and user analysis.
              The original dataset consists of around 4.8 million rows with 5 columns (date, timestamp, uid, utmSource,
              isFirst). The only attribute with NaN entires is ‘utmSource’ (1674386 NaN).<br>

              Before jumping into the main parts of the analysis, some initial investigations and pre processing were
              taken.

            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Sort Based on Timestamp</li>
              <li>Remove Duplicates</li>
              <li>Remove [date/timestamp/uid] Combination Duplicates</li>
              <li>Handle Entires with More than One ‘isFirst’</li>
              <li>Check the Entries with Delayed First Time Occurrence Recorded </li>
              <li>Source Names Correction and Modification(this will be done at question three)</li>
            </ul> 

            <br>
            <p style="font-size:20px; text-align:justify;"><b>Question 1 : Daily Active Users (DAU)</p></b>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"> The number of daily active users is a vital metric for business. The main
              goal of a business should be
              growth. DAU and its trend show how a product is successful in its growth path. While DAU has a
              straightforward definition, it can be seen and calculated on different segments of the users. </p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12 first-chart container-chart">
          <iframe src="Chart%201/chart_a.html" height="100%" width="100%" title="chart1"></iframe>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-12 secont">
        <div class="col-xs-12 sec-chart-desc">
          <div class="well well-lg">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">DAU is defined for the number of <b>unique users</b>. Therefore, it’s
              essential to
              make sure that some users are not counted more than once. To do so, I grouped the DataFrame by date and
              counted the number of unique ids (.nunique method). <br><br>
              As I mentioned, the DAU also can be seen based on a specific feature. I created a new column as
              <b>isRegistered</b>, based on the ‘uid’ column. It would be helpful to see what portion of the daily users
              are registered and what portion is not registered. <br><br>
              As the above chart shows, the DAU for all users is increased by <b>23.2%</b> over this month, Febrauray
              2016. Also DAU is growing clearly in registered categories <b>25.8%</b>, although non-registered users'
              growth rate <b>12.5%</b> is very low compared to the registered group. One other interesting detail is
              that
              both registered and non-registered categories follow weekly cycles (with lower DAU on weekends)
            </p><br>

            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;"><b>Question 2 : Retention Curve Across Various Cohorts</b>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"> The retention calculates the percentage of the users who use the
              product each day. The retention curve can help the business how they are doing in total regarding their
              initial user attraction. Retention/churn calculation is an excellent way to calculate and visualize the
              life cycle of users. </p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12 second-chart container-chart">
          <iframe src="Chart%202/chart_b2.html" height="100%" width="100%" title="chart2"></iframe>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-12 third">
        <div class="col-xs-12 sec-chart-desc">
          <div class="well well-lg">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">For this specific exercise, the retention curve is
              calculated for three certain cohorts: Feb 4th, Feb 10th, and Feb 14th.
              According to the above heatmap, all cohorts show relatively similar behavior regarding the cohort life
              cycle. All cohorts show very deep decrease(~40-45%) in retention on the first day. This tells us that
              around half of the users do not have a good experience on their first day. Also for all cohorts, the
              weekly low retention percentage is Saturday. <br>
              If you look closer, it seems that cohort 10th and 14th February worked more successfully to keep their
              users throughout the month. However, before jumping to the conclusion, we need to investigate the cohorts'
              users deeper. Some factors such as traffic sources, user devices, and so on may explain this difference
              across cohorts. Also, it is good to track the app updates timeline. The other possible reason could be
              some updates during 4th and 10th Feb. </p>

        <div class="col-xs-12 third-chart container-chart">
          <iframe src="Chart%203/chart_c.html" height="100%" width="100%" title="chart2"></iframe>

      <div class="col-xs-12 fourth">

        <div class="col-xs-12 fourth-chart container-chart">
          <iframe src="Chart%204/chart_c2.html" height="100%" width="100%" title="chart2"></iframe>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-12 fifth">
        <div class="col-xs-12 sec-chart-desc">
          <div class="well well-lg">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Cohorts 4th and 14th Feb have an almost identical number of users (~2700),
              while cohort 10th Feb has around 15% more users. This increase from the past week should be explored more
              carefully since the number of users for cohort 14th Feb returned to the number of cohort 4th Feb. I
              suspect that there was a marketing campaign during the days before 10th Feb. The last point that we need
              to pay attention to is the starting day of each cohort. The first two cohorts started in the middle of the
              week, but the cohort 14th Feb begun on the weekend, and maybe that was why the initial number of users is
              lower than cohort 10th Feb. </p><br><br>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;"><b>Question 3 : Traffic Sources and User Analysis</b></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">In this part, several metrics are defined to identify the best traffic
              sources and users. Before starting source analysis, the name of sources should be cleaned and modified
              using regex. For instance, twitter and Twitter_org should be combined. </p>
            <p style="font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;"><b> A - Daily Unique Actice Users per Source</b></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The first metric for analyzing the sources is <b> Daily Unique Active Users
                per Sources </b>. This metric is valuable because it shows the power of each source as the gate for our
              product. <br><br>
              First, I need to make sure that each user just used one source to come into our app each day. Therefore, I
              grouped the data frame by combining date and user id and counting unique sources. There are 1002 out of
              around 3.3 million cases (0.03%) that users used more than one source in some days. So I dropped these
              rows.

              For calculating this metric, I grouped the DataFrame by combining date and source and then counting the
              number of unique user ids. Some sources have a minimal number of users. The average daily unique users for
              all sources is around 116098. So I assign the threshold as 580 (~0.5%) of the daily users to filter out
              some sources that do not bring much value for our business. After all, I came up with 11 unique sources
              (including one group as “NA”) that make most of our traffic sources.
              The below chart shows that all top sources show a relatively slight uptrend. 4 sources that bring more
              than 80% of our daily traffic are: “biznesow rewolujce” , “NA”, “answers” and “program”.

            <p style="font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;"><b> B - Daily User Activity Distribution per Source</b></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The other insightful metric can be the “Daily User Activity Distribution”
              for each source. This metric shows that from all users of a source, what portion use the app more
              frequently. In other words, this metric shows how consistent users are in their usage of the application
              through the month. We value the sources that have a peak close to the full month (29 days).
              To calculate this metric, I grouped the data frame by user id and source and counted the number of unique
              days. The result shows the number of activity days for each user using a certain traffic source. Finally,
              I grouped the output data frame per number of days and source, counted the number of users, and calculated
              the percentage of the total number of days entries for each source.
              The below chart demonstrates the user activity distribution per source. The top 5 sources that have
              relatively better activity and have a local peak around the right end of the graph are : “shmoop”,
              “salesmango”, “twitter”, ”program” and “grub street”.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">In order to analyze the best and worst users, certain metrics should be
              defined. Again, these metrics may vary from business to business and based on the significant goals of the
              company. For the sake of the project, I am defining metrics based on my insight and perception.
              "Average Daily Ping" can be a good metric. This shows to what extent each user is involved in our
              business.
              To calculate this metric, I need to group the df per day and user id and count the occurrence (timestamp
              can be used to count the occurrence). Then the output df should be grouped per user id and calculate the
              mean based on the total days. <br>
              Initial investigation showed that almost 83% of the top 1000 users came from “NA” source. Excluding NA top
              users with ‘NA’ source showed that “biznesowe rewolucje”, “program”, “shmoop”, and “twitter” brings most
              of the top users.</p>

          <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;"><b> Summary and Final Thoughts</b></p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Analysis of user and traffic source behavior may have a complicated path and
            structure. A wide range of metrics can be investigated based on the business life stage, strategy, and
            mission. The business may want to be more inclusive and bring in more people from more traffic sources or be
            more focused and focused more on top users and specific traffic sources.
            Regarding Grammarly, I perceive it wants to be more inclusive; therefore, we should pay more attention to
            DAU. Based on our analysis, almost half of the first users did not continue to use our product after the
            first day. We can conclude that we need to work more on users' boarding experiences. The additional insight
            that could be helpful in this regard can be analyzing the unsatisfied first users, check the traffic source
            and the features that they mostly used on their first experience.
            Also, it would be great to check whether the non-satisfied users vary across user devices and platforms or
            not. For instance, maybe the product lacks is not very user-friendly in specific operating systems.
            The other good area worth investigating is exploring the sources that have a high churning degree for first
            time users. Studying users from these sources may help us find some potential to grow.</p><br>
