Ping Analysis of Grammarly

In this project, I investigated app/product performance from various aspects such as Daily Active User, Retention Curve, Traffic Source Analysis, etc., during February 2016. 


1 - Daily Active Users (DAU)

The number of daily active users is a vital metric for business. The main goal of a business should be growth. DAU and its trend show how a product is successful in its growth path. While DAU has a straightforward definition, it can be seen and calculated on different segments of the users.

2 - Retention Curve Across Various Cohorts

The retention calculates the percentage of the users who use the product each day. The retention curve can help the business how they are doing in total regarding their initial user attraction. Retention/churn calculation is an excellent way to calculate and visualize the life cycle of users.
